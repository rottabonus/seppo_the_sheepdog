## Seppo the sheepdog

### About

This is my first Godot-game, and also almost first game ever. Certainly the first game I ever made that had graphics and sound!
I was momentarily inspired when I played Animal Well a few weeks ago, and I felt a need to create something.
I knew I would not have the skills and patience to make anything amazing, so I tried to keep the game as small as possible.
One can argue is Seppo the sheepdog even a game but still I am happy about the end result.

I enjoyed the process of creating something. Definitely might become a hobby!
The most difficult thing turned out to be making music.


### Software used

- Graphics: Aseprite
- Music: LMMS, and then after frustration FL Studio. (In the end I don't think the software made any difference)
- Game: Godot
