In that quiet moment, as Seppo catched the bone.
He felt a profound realization wash over him. 
His master, who had always been there, 
who had cared for him, fed him, and shown him love,
was the embodiment of goodness.
The treats, the kind words, the gentle pats on the head.
These were not just acts of kindness, but expressions of a deeper truth.
Seppo understood that the 'good boy' was not just about being a dog or fulfilling a role.
It was about the connection, the bond between souls.
His master, through his actions... 
had shown Seppo the true nature of goodnessâ€”unconditional love, selflessness, and a giving heart.
