Seppo the sheepdog was sunmaxing.
It was a perfectly normal day at the farm.
Master was happy and the sheep were eating grass and what not.
However as Seppo roamed on the field, he noticed being troubled.
A profound question rippled through the air: "Who is the good boy?" 
This query, simple yet profound, resonated deep within Seppo's being. 
It was a question that transcended the mundane, touching the very essence of existence itself.
